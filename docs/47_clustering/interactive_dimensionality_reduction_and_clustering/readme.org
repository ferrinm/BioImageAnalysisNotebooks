* Interactive dimensionality reduction and clustering
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: interactive-dimensionality-reduction-and-clustering
  :END:
The
[[https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-clusters-plotter][napari-clusters-plotter]]
offers tools to perform various dimensionality reduction algorithms and
clustering methods interactively in Napari.

** Getting started
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: getting-started
   :END:
Open a terminal window and activate your conda environment:

#+begin_example
conda activate devbio-napari-env
#+end_example

Afterwards, start up Napari:

#+begin_example
napari
#+end_example

Load the "Blobs" example dataset from the menu
=File > Open Sample > clEsperanto > Blobs (from ImageJ)=. We also need a
label image. You can create it using the menu
=Tools > Segmentation / labeling > Gauss-Otsu Labeling (clesperanto)=.

** Starting point
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: starting-point
   :END:
For clustering objects according to their properties, the starting point
is an intensity image and a label image representing a segmentation of
objects.

** Measurements
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: measurements
   :END:
The first step is extracting measurements from the labeled image and the
corresponding pixels in the intensity image. You can use the menu
=Tools > Measurement > Regionprops (scikit-image, nsr)= for that. Just
select the intensity image, the corresponding label image and the
measurements =intensity=, =size= and =shape= and click on =Run=. A table
with the measurements will open:

[[file:measure.png]]

Afterwards, you can save and/or close the measurement table. Also, close
the Measure widget.

** Plotting
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: plotting
   :END:
Once measurements were made, these measurements were saved in the
=features= of the labels layer which was analysed. You can then plot
these measurements using the menu
=Tools > Measurement > Plot measurements (ncp)=.

In this widget, you can select the labels layer which was analysed and
the measurements which should be plotted on the X- and Y-axis. If you
cannot see any options in axes selection boxes, but you have performed
measurements, click on =Update Axes/Clustering Selection Boxes= to
refresh them. Click on =Run= to draw the data points in the plot area.

[[file:plot_plain.png]]

You can also manually select a region in the plot. Use the mouse to draw
an outline around the region of interest. The resulting manual
clustering will also be visualized in the original image. To optimize
visualization in the image, turn off the visibility of the analysed
labels layer.

Hold down the SHIFT key while annotating regions in the plot to manually
select multiple clusters.

** Dimensionality reduction: UMAP, t-SNE or PCA
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dimensionality-reduction-umap-t-sne-or-pca
   :END:
For getting more insights into your data, you can reduce the
dimensionality of the measurements, e.g. using the
[[https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][UMAP algorithm]],
[[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html][t-SNE]]
or
[[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html][PCA]]
algorithms. To apply them to your data use the menu
=Tools > Measurement > Dimensionality reduction (ncp)=. Select the label
image that was analysed and in the list below, select all measurements
that should be dimensionality reduced. By default, all measurements are
selected in the box. If you cannot see any measurements, but you have
performed them, click on =Update Measurements= to refresh the box. You
can read more about parameters of both algorithms by hovering over
question marks or by clicking on them. When you are done with the
selection, click on =Run= and after a moment, the table of measurements
will re-appear with two additional columns representing the reduced
dimensions of the dataset. These columns are automatically saved in the
=features= of the labels layer.

[[file:umap.png]]

Afterwards, you can again save and/or close the table. Also, close the
Dimensionality Reduction widget.

** Clustering
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: clustering
   :END:
If the data points are clearly separated, automatic clustering may be an
option, using these implemented algorithms: *
[[https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-algorithm-applications-evaluation-methods-and-drawbacks-aa03e644b48a][k-means
clustering (KMEANS)]] *
[[https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html][Hierarchical
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN)]]
* [[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html][Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM)]] *
[[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_mean_shift.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-cluster-plot-mean-shift-py][Mean
Shift (MS)]] *
[[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html][Agglomerative
clustering (AC)]]

Therefore, click the menu =Tools > Measurement > Clustering (ncp)= and
select the analysed labels layer. This time select the measurements for
clustering, e.g.Â select /only/ the =UMAP= measurements. Select the
clustering method =KMeans= and click on =Run=. The table of measurements
will reappear with an additional column =KMeans_CLUSTERING_ID=
containing the cluster ID of each datapoint.

[[file:clustering.png]]

Afterwards, you can again save and/or close the table. Also, close the
clustering widget.

** Plotting clustering results
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: plotting-clustering-results
   :END:
Return to the Plotter widget using the menu
=Tools > Measurement > Plot measurements (ncp)=. Select =UMAP_0= and
=UMAP_1= as X- and Y-axis and the =KMeans_CLUSTERING_ID= as
=Clustering=, and click on =Run=.
