Start napari from the command line like this:

#+begin_src sh
conda activate my_first_env

napari
#+end_src

Start the Napari Assistant from the =Tools > Utilities > Assistant (na)=
menu.

Within the =Assistant= panel, click on the =Remove noise= button.

Click on the =Eye= buttons in the layer list to hide the original image
and show the result of the =Remove noise= step only.

Click on the =Binarize= button in the Assistant panel to add a new step
to the workflow that generates a binary image from the current layer.

Toggle 2D/3D view and layer visibility to explore the result of the
=Binarize= step.

After switching back to 2D view, click the =Label= button in the
Assistant and choose the operation
=Connected component labeling (clEsperanto)=.

Select the =Result of gaussian_blur= layer in the layer list and modify
its =sigma= parameters. You will note that the subsequent steps
(Threshold Otsu and Connected Component Labeling) are also updated.

Switch to grid view, show all layers using their =Eye= buttons and
continue modifying the parameters.

[[file:images/napari-assistant14.jpg]]

Close all layers except =nuclei= and =membrane=.

Turn of Gridview and click again on the =Label= button in the Assistant.

This time, do not change the operation but the =spot_sigma= parameter
instead.
