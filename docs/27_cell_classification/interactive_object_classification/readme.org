* Interactive object classification in Napari
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: interactive-object-classification-in-napari
  :END:
In this exercise we will train a
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest][Random Forest
Classifiers]] for classifying segmented objects. We will use the napari
plugin
[[https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification][napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification]].

** Getting started
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: getting-started
   :END:
Open a terminal window and activate your conda environment:

#+begin_example
conda activate devbio-napari-env
#+end_example

Afterwards, start up Napari:

#+begin_example
napari
#+end_example

Load the "Blobs" example dataset from the menu
=File > Open Sample > clEsperanto > Blobs (from ImageJ)=

We furthermore need a label image. You can create it using the
[[file:machine_learning:pixel_classification][pixel classifier trained
earlier]] or using the menu
=Tools > Segmentation / labeling > Gauss-Otsu Labeling (clesperanto)=.

** Object classification
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: object-classification
   :END:
Our starting point is a loaded image and a label image with segmented
objects. The following procedure is also shown in
[[file:apoc_object_classification.mp4][this video]].

[[file:apoc21.png]]

Add another label image. Rename the label image e.g.Â to
=Label class annotation= to not mix it up with the other.
[[file:apoc22.png]]

Activate the =Brush tool=. [[file:apoc23.png]]

Put small dots with label =1= into small roundish objects (for training
purposes: really just the smaller ones). [[file:apoc24.png]]

Increase the =label= to =2=. [[file:apoc25.png]]

Draw a line throught the larger elongated objects in the center of the
image. [[file:apoc26.png]]

Start the object classification tool from the menu
=Tools > Segmentation post-processing > Object classification (APOC)=
[[file:apoc27.png]]

In this user-interface, activate the =shape= checkbox.
[[file:apoc28.png]]

Select =image=, =labels= and =annotation= like this: [[file:apoc29.png]]

Click on =Run=. After a second a new labels layer with brown / blue
annotated objects should appear. Some larger round objects will be blue
unintentionally. [[file:apoc30.png]]

Hide the newly created classification layer. [[file:apoc31.png]]

Select your annotation layer. [[file:apoc32.png]]

Annotate some more roundish objects, this time the larger ones.
[[file:apoc33.png]]

Train the classifier again. [[file:apoc34.png]]

If you are happy with the trained classifier, copy the file to a safe
place. When training the next classifier this one might be overwritten.

** Extra exercise
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: extra-exercise
   :END:
Retrain the classifier so that it can differentiate three different
classes: * Small round objects * Large round objects * Large elongated
objects
