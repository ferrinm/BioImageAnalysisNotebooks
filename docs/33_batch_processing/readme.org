[[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/batch-processing.asp][Batch
processing]] comes into play when we want to process multiple images in
the same way. One example of batch processing would be to loop over a
folder of images using a for-loop to apply a segmentation-workflow.

For an example using the =zip= function to process paired images and
masks, see [[file:16_zip_folders.ipynb][16_zip_folders]].
