* Querying databases

  :END:
A common task in data science is to combine data sources to gain new
insights. These tasks are typically done using relational databases,
collections of tables. The
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL][Structured Query Language]] (SQL)
is the tool of choice when it comes to querying databases. When working
with Pandas dataframes in Python, we can use the
[[https://github.com/yhat/pandasql/][pandasql]] library for using SQL
with [[https://pandas.pydata.org/][pandas]], more precisely, it uses
[[https://www.sqlite.org/][SQLite]].
