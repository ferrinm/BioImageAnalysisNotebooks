In times when graphics cards are hardly available on the market and
often sold overpriced, there are also many GPU-acceleration libraries
available. We haven't covered all those in this chapter and thus, should
at least provide a list for further reading.

  pandas, based on CUDA]]

Deep learning became possible due to developments in GPU technology in
the past decade. Hence, deep-learning libraries technially are also
libraries that offer some form of GPU-acceleration. Many of them are
also capable of processing images.
