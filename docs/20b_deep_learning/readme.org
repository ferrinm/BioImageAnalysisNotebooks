For using [[https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/][cellpose]] and
[[https://github.com/stardist/stardist][stardist]], these dependencies
must be installed:

#+begin_example
mamba install cellpose pytorch=1.8.2 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch-lts
pip install tensorflow
pip install stardist
#+end_example

The notebooks in this folder have been tested using * =torch==2.0.1= *
=stardist==0.8.3= * =tensorflow==2.12.0= * =csbdeep==0.7.3= *
=cellpose==2.2.1=
