* Surface processing
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
In this chapter we will process surface data. Surfaces, also known as
meshes consist of points in 3D space, so called vertices, that are
connected to each other forming triangles, also known as faces. Many
triangles together form a surface. If the surface is closed so that no
ray could go from the inside to the outside without crossing a triangle,
the surface is called watertight.

** Installing requirements

   :END:
We will use the [[https://vedo.embl.es/][vedo]] library for processing
and visualizing surfaces and the programmable napari plugin
[[https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces][napari-process-points-and-surfaces]].
Both can be installed like this:

#+begin_example
mamba install vedo
pip install napari-process-points-and-surfaces
#+end_example
