* Image visualization in 3D
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
Visualizing three-dimensional image data on a flat computer screen is
challenging, especially when working with scripting languages such as
Python. In this chapter, we will introduce the concepts of slicing and
projecting image data. Furthermore, we will start using the
n-dimensional image viewer [[https://napari.org][napari]].
