In this chapter we will apply some strategies to optimize parameters of
image processing workflows. In general, it is important to have
high-quality ground truth data, such as manually segmented images.
Furthermore, a well-engineered fitness function (sometimes also called
loss-function) is necessary. For parameter optimization we will use
[[https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html][scipy's
optimize package]] and the Napari plugin
[[https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer][napari-workflow-optimizer]].
