* Machine learning for image segmentation
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: machine-learning-for-image-segmentation
  :END:
In this chapter we will use /classical/ machine learning for pixel
classification, object segmentation and for generating probability maps.
We will use [[https://scikit-learn.org/][scikit-learn]] for that and
[[https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc][APOC]] which is a
image-processing specific library which brings GPU-accelerated pixel and
object classification.

** Installation of requirements
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: installation-of-requirements
   :END:
For execution of the notebooks in this chapter we should install
scikit-learn and apoc, e.g.Â using pip:

#+begin_example
pip install scikit-learn
pip install apoc
#+end_example
