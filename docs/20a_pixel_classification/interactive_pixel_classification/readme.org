(machine_learning:pixel_classification)= # Interactive pixel
classification and object segmentation in Napari

In this exercise we will train a
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest][Random Forest
Classifier]] for pixel classification and convert the result in an
instance segmentation. We will use the napari plugin
[[https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification][napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification]].

** Getting started
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: getting-started
   :END:
Open a terminal window and activate your conda environment:

#+begin_example
conda activate devbio-napari-env
#+end_example

Afterwards, start up Napari:

#+begin_example
napari
#+end_example

Load the "Blobs" example dataset from the menu
=File > Open Sample > clEsperanto > Blobs (from ImageJ)=

** Pixel classification and Object Segmentation in Napari
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: pixel-classification-and-object-segmentation-in-napari
   :END:
For segmenting objects, we can use the Object Segmentation tool in APOC.
Under the hood it uses a pixel classifier and
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling][connected
component labeling]]. The following procedure is also shown in
[[file:apoc_object_segmentation.mp4][this video]].

Start the object segmentation from the
=Tools > Segmentation / Labeling > Object Segmentation (APOC)= menu.

Add a new labels layer by clicking on this button: [[file:apoc3.png]]

Change the brush size to a small number such as 2 or 3.
[[file:apoc4.png]]

Click on the =Paint brush= button. [[file:apoc5.png]]

Start annotating the =background= region where there is no object.
[[file:apoc6.png]]

Increase the label that is drawn by one. [[file:apoc7.png]]

Draw an annotation within the objects of interest. Draw background and
object annotation close by each other. The closer these two annotations
are drawn, the smaller is the degree of freedom the computer has when
optimizing the model later. [[file:apoc8.png]]

Within the =Object segmentation= user interface on the right, select the
image/channel that should be processed. [[file:apoc9.png]]

Also select the annotation label image you have just drawn.
[[file:apoc10.png]]

Click on =Train=. A label image should show up. [[file:apoc11.png]]

If the segmentation works well, consider backing up the
=ObjectSegmenter.cl= file that has been saved. If you didn't change the
file location before training, it will be located in the folder from
where you started napari on the command line.
