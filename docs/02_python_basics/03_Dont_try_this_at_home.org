  :END:
You can execute the same cell in Jupyter notebooks multiple times. This
may lead to notebooks which make no sense to the reader.

<<metallic-classification>>
#+begin_src python
a = 5
b = 5
#+end_src

<<wired-crowd>>
#+begin_src python
a = a + 1
#+end_src

<<shaped-capital>>
#+begin_src python
a + b
#+end_src

You can execute them in the wrong order which leads to the same effect.

#+begin_src python
d = 5
#+end_src

<<military-bedroom>>
#+begin_src python
d = 10
#+end_src

<<radical-shakespeare>>
#+begin_src python
d
#+end_src

#+begin_example
5
#+end_example

You can see that cells were executed in wrong order, repeatedly or not
subsequently, by reading the number =In [?]= on the left.

Tip: When your notebook is ready, click on menu
=Kernel > Restart & Run all= to make sure all cells in the notebook are
executed in the right order.
